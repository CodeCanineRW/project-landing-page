# Post Project Analysis

After completing the first version of this project (commit 7), there are a couple areas that could be improved or possibly done differently. These are listed here as a reminder to improve on the next project, or to incorporate if this project is revisited. 

1. I may have used more flexboxes than needed for the individual sections, nesting more than necessary. I initially did this thinking it would help in responsive / scaling design and would make adding additional content or making changes easier. I may review and test leaving some sections typical block items. 

2. The HTML outline could have used more semantic elements instead of creating a div for everything, and giving it a class. For example, div class="footer" would have been better as a footer element. Also, maybe more use of section and article / header elements. The nav links could have been a nav element as well. 

3. I have not had a lot of experience with ems and rems, but some of the larger margins, padding, etc. could probably have been better served set with rem values instead of pixels for everything.
